About me, and this website
==========================

About me
--------

Born in 1979, living in [Limassol, Cyprus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol).

### Work ###

I currently work as a Linux Systems Administrator at [PrimeTel](http://primetel.com.cy/). 
I have previously worked at PrimeTel's <abbr title='Network Operations Center'>NOC</abbr>, 
and at [Lapso Co Ltd](http://lapsoco.com/), [MasterSoft](http://www.mastersoft.com.cy/), 
[DomCons Ltd](http://www.domcons.com/) and [Entropy Data Ltd](http://www.entropydata.com/).

I have also done some web development as a freelancer (hasn't everybody?), and 
I currently manage a few servers, offering shared and dedicated web hosting.

### Education ###

I started studying [Architecture](http://www.arch.ntua.gr/) at 
<abbr title='National Technological University of Athens'>NTUA</abbr>, but 
gave it up. I then studied 
[Computer Science](http://www.lim.intercollege.ac.cy/index.php/programmes-and-courses/academic-programmes/computer-science.html) 
at [InterCollege](http://www.intercollege.ac.cy/).

I currently hold the following certifications:

*   Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician
*   Cisco Certified Network Associate (#CSCO11919413, 2011-05-06 - 2014-05-05)
*   CompTIA Linux+ (#COMP001020362554, 2012-04-20)

*   Novell Certified SUSE 11 Technical Specialist

### Other ###

I am an amateur musician. If you are looking for a peaceful apartment, 
stay away from my building. I also like to aggregate useless stuff, I 
now have about 400 miniature cars, 100 vinyl records and non-counted-yet 
books. Unfortunately, due to moving between apartments, I had to throw 
away my collections of old magazines, and kept only the most interesting.

### Digital Footprint ###

*   Greek and English WikiPedia contributor.
*   GNOME and Ubuntu Translator.
*   Flickr

About this website
------------------

This blog is my blah in the global interwebs.

### Platform ###

This website is maintained with Zalza, my Python script for generating 
static HTML from Markdown text files.

Previously, the blog part of the site was the awesome WordPress, and 
the docs part was the very readable, very usable and very frustrating 
to hack MediaWiki. Having spent hours and hours checking out the code 
of the two, I concluded that A. WordPress is poetry, and B. it is a 
miracle that MediaWiki even works.

### Appearance ###

Currently, this website uses Twitter Bootstrap for its visual appearance, with 
a few minor style changes.

In its previous iteration, it used Bootstrap with the SpaceLab theme.

Previously, while being far from a designer, I had stitched 
together the looks of this website from the dead bodies of other looks 
that I liked and dissected, and I ended up liking it. The theme for that 
version started from Modernist, a WordPress theme by Rodrigo Galindez, 
with endless small modifications. However, the fonts were mostly ripped 
off Vector, the default theme for MediaWiki.
