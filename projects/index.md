Projects
========

Zalza
-----

This script generates the content of my website. It traverses a directory of 
sources, mostly written in Markdown, and produces static HTML files. It is 
triggered by a `post-merge` Git hook on the web server. [Fork on GitHub][1].

BackupPC Archive Script
-----------------------

This is a script that can create archives of backups taken with [BackupPC][2]. 
It can be used to keep an offsite copy of the latest backup of a host. 
[Fork on GitHub][3].

Briki WP Registration Whitelist
-------------------------------

This is a WordPress plugin that I wrote in April of 2011, that matches a new
user's email against a whitelist during the user registration process. It was a
request in the Greek WordPress Users' Forum (then wordpress.gr now gone).
[Fork on GitHub][4].
