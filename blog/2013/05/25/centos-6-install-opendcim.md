openDCIM 2.1 Installation on Centos 6
=================================

[openDCIM](http://www.opendcim.org/) is a free and open source solution
for **D**ata**C**enter **I**nfrastructure **M**anagement. It is already 
used by a few organizations, and is quickly improving due to the efforts 
of its [developers](http://www.opendcim.org/developers.html).

I have written [a complete, bottom-up installation for openDCIM on 
CentOS](/docs/centos-6-install-opendcim-2.1.html). This will get you up 
to the first screen in the web interface, after which you can follow 
[Scott Milliken's video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzEI6Z8yhRg) 
for the initial settings of the application.

The guide is written for openDCIM 2.1, but should be fairly applicable 
to newer versions.

[Read the full installation guide here](/docs/centos-6-install-opendcim-2.1.html).
