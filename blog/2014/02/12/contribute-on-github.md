Contribute to an open source project on GitHub
==============================================

I don't contribute to open source projects as much as I would like to. 
As a result, I forget the sequence of actions required to do so, when 
a project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). To overcome that, 
I wrote down the procedure in a how-to guide. I hope it will be useful 
to others as well.

[Read the guide: How to contribute to open source projects on Github](/docs/contribute-on-github.html)
