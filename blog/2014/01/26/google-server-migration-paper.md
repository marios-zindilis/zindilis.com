Google Servers Migration Paper
==============================

This has to be the coolest paper I 've read in a long time. It explains 
how a few engineers working at Google, migrated thousands of servers 
from the ancient RedHat Linux 7.1 to a modern version of Debian, with 
minimum downtime, by replacing small bits of the operating system at a 
time, in many many iterations.

The paper is from a USENIX Conference, here you go, and you're very 
welcome: [Live upgrading thousands of servers from an ancient Red Hat 
distribution to 10 year newer Debian based one](http://marc.merlins.org/linux/talks/ProdNG-LCA2014/Paper/ProdNG.pdf).
