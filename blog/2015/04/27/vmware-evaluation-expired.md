Features disabled when VMware Evaluation Expires
================================================

As a note to myself and a future reference, here is a list of features of 
VMware ESXi 6 that get disabled when the 60-day evaluation period expires:

I registered as a Beta tester and installed this evaluation version of ESXi 6 
before it went into general availability, so there might be some differences 
compared to GA versions, but it's not likely.
