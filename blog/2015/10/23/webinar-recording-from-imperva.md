Webinar recording from Imperva
==============================

This is a recording of a webinar that I watched this week, titled 
*"Balancing Ecommerce Security with Performance"*. The speakers are from two 
companies, Imperva and Incapsula, both of which offer some security-related 
solutions, so there is some product plugging going on during the talks, however 
there is a good amount of introductory web application security information.

The most useful bit in my opinion was pointing out [demo.testfire.net][1], a 
test website that is open to SQL Injection for demostration purposes, and thus 
it can be useful as a security awareness training material.
