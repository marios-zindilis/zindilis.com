Notes and links from PyCon 2015
===============================

These are a couple of random links from things mentioned in talks during PyCon 
2015, which took place in Dublin in October 2015. There were two tracks of 
talks and two tracks of workshops. One of the non-workshop tracks was almost 
dedicated to data processing with Python, and the other had various subjects. 
I followed the latter track.

[PyCon 2015][pycon-2015] was organized by [Python Ireland][python-ireland], and 
took place on the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> of October 2015.

*   [redact-py][redact-py] is an Open Source Redis ORM, very simple to use and 
    with good performance.
*   [Larry Hastings][larry-hastings] talked about 
    [Python's Infamous GIL][python-infamous-gil] and the challenges of 
    multithreadded Python software.
