Regular expressions in python-markdown2 (part 1)
================================================

<p class="lead">This article is a look into the performance of one of the
regular expressions used in the 
<a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2" 
title="python-markdown2 on Github"> python-markdown2</a> Python module for 
converting Markdown syntax to HTML. It was initially written for pure fun, and 
in celebration of its own pointlessness, but eventually the changes proposed
here made it upstream in
<a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/pull/204">pull request 
204</a>.</p>

Standardize line endings
------------------------

This regular expression appears very early in the conversion process:

```python
text = re.sub("\r\n|\r", "\n", text)
```

Its use is fairly obvious: it changes all single carriage returns (`\r`) and 
all carriage returns followed by a newline (`\r\n`) to single newlines (`\n`).
The same effect can be achieved in Python with two `str.replace()` statements 
and in fact that would be much faster. The following example uses `timeit`, 
which comes with the IPython shell:

```python
%timeit 'Apples\r\nOranges\r\nKiwis\rGrapes\r'.replace('\r\n', '\n')
1000000 loops, best of 3: 270 ns per loop

%timeit 'Apples\r\nOranges\r\nKiwis\rGrapes\r'.replace('\r', '\n')
1000000 loops, best of 3: 195 ns per loop

%timeit re.sub(r'\r\n|\r', '\n', 'Apples\r\nOranges\r\nKiwis\rGrapes\r')
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.31 us per loop
```

So the two runs of `str.replace()` add up to 465 nanoseconds, whereas one run 
of `re.sub()` takes 2.31 microseconds, that is 2310 nanoseconds, or about 
**five times slower**. 

The question is: *Does it matter?* Well, my copy of 
*The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* that includes all five books in the 
series, is 776 pages long, and each full page has 42 lines (yes, I counted 
twice, and now I am wondering if it was done on purpose). Following up on the 
previous calculations, if you had to convert that book from Markdown to HTML, 
(about 32592 lines), it would take you a whole 0.02 seconds to do that with 
`re.sub()`, or about 0.004 seconds to do that with `str.replace()`. 
Therefore, the answer to my previous question: *Does it matter?* is 42.

Now the question becomes: *Does it **really** matter?* Well, if you had to 
convert all 30 million paperback books that Amazon has for sale (number found 
through a search on amazon.com), and assuming each book is as healthy in size 
as <abbr title="The Hitch Hicker's Guide To The Galaxy">THHGTTG</abbr>, then it 
would take you a week to do that with `re.sub()`, but only a day and a 
half to do it with `str.replace()`. Thus, for the Python developer out there 
who is pondering on converting 30 million books from Markdown to HTML, the 
answer is: Go with `str.replace()`. For the rest of us it's still 42.
