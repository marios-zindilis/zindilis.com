Hello, World!
=============

Having the day off today, I got to catch up with some reading that was in the 
"to-read" bookmarks (unordered) list:

*   [Ubuntu: Where did the love go?](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3925641/Ubuntu-Where-Did-the-Love-Go.htm)
*   [Terror in the north: Canada loses grip on reality](http://www.infoworld.com/print/150364)
*   [Nine traits of the veteran Unix admin](http://www.infoworld.com/print/151276)
*   [When in doubt, reboot? Not Unix boxes](http://www.infoworld.com/print/152061)
*   [Using HTML5 To Transform the WordPress TwentyTen Theme](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/02/22/using-html5-to-transform-wordpress-twentyten-theme/)

For a few minutes I jumped from [article to article by Paul Venezia](http://www.infoworld.com/d/data-center/blogs), 
then I subscribed to [his feed](http://www.infoworld.com/blogs/paul-venezia/feed), 
but not without the bitter thought that I will probably not really have the 
time to read it.

P.S. I was surprised at how ungracefully Chromium handles a link to an RSS 
feed, compared to Firefox and Opera, which include a default style for that 
XML type. WTF Google?
