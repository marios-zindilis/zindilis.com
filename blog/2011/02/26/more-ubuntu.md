More Ubuntu
===========

I 've been doing some Ubuntu-related reading, and I have to say my faith 
is shaken. I have been a user of Ubuntu for many versions now, my main 
point being that the defaults were just right for me, so I could just 
start using my system post-installation. It's those defaults that are 
now changing in bulk.

*   [Banshee Amazon Store disabled in Ubuntu 11.04 by Canonical](http://www.networkworld.com/community/banshee-amazon-store-disabled-by-canonical-in-ubuntu) (deprecated)
*   [Canonical calls original proposal a "mistake" and overrides Banshee team's decision](http://www.networkworld.com/community/canonical-alters-banshee-agreement)
*   [Banshee developer's Gabriel Burt's blog](http://gburt.blogspot.com/)
*   [A smart cash flow diagram](http://ndftz.com/nickelanddime.png)
*   [Canonical slips their own Affiliate ID in Firefox also?](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mozillateam/firefox/firefox-4.0.head/view/head:/debian/patches/ubuntu-codes-amazon.patch)

I suppose there are two ways to see this. On one hand, Canonical is 
for-profit and needs to make money, on the other hand, Banshee has been 
donating to GNOME some close to $10000 yearly (but we don't know how 
does 25% of the Ubuntu crowd compare to 100% of the rest), which in 
turn benefited Ubuntu because it was using GNOME. So I assume that 
Canonical has calculated that they will profit more by directly 
obtaining 75% of Amazon sales through Banshee, than by a better GNOME, 
and what with Ubuntu's turn a bit away from GNOME in the coming 
releases, should they care?

This will take me some more time to absorb. I 'll be as reluctant (read 
*inert*) in changing my main setup as anyone who uses computers 16h/day 
would be.
