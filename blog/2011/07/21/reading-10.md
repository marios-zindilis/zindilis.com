Reading #10
===========

<h3>Linux</h3>
I finished reading Sams - Teach yourself Red Hat Linux. This book tries to cover the very basics of a wide range of topics, from installation and basic usage on the desktop and on the console, to systems administration, user management, nfs, smb, web and ftp serving and basic security. Therefore, this is a good book for the beginner who aims high. So, I should have read it a few years ago - I felt bored at times.

<h3>More Google+ hoopla:</h3>

<h3>Misc</h3>
