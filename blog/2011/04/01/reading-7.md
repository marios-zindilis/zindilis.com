Reading #7
==========

These "reading" posts are doomed to scarcity after I return to work in a couple of weeks. I will miss the time to actually read interesting articles that come my way, instead of stacking them in the to-read bookmarks list. I have to note that some half of today's links come from <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.

<h3>Misc geek reading:</h3>
<ul><li>An interesting story, on how this guy <a href="http://iandennismiller.com/blog/2011/03/petite-lap-giraffes/">wrote an article on fake dwarf giraffes</a>, then a <a href="http://iandennismiller.com/blog/2011/03/total-bummer-longislandpress-com-plagiarism-and-coverup/">newspaper plagiarized it</a>, but ended up editing it to <a href="http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/03/28/petite-lap-giraffes-real-or-directv-marketing-campaign/">provide proper attribution</a>.</li>

<li>This one in Greek: AEPI, the Greek organization that handles Intellectual Property on behalf of creators, is asking from <a href="http://www.livemovies.gr/">livemovies.gr</a> to stop <a href="http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_civ_1_26/03/2011_436872">linking to greek tv shows that are available for streaming on third party websites</a>. The funny thing is that some of the links that I checked out, are pointing to the websites of the TV networks that are the copyright holders, who themselves are making these shows available for streaming. So livemovies.gr is just aggregating them. The <a href="http://elawyer.blogspot.com/">lawyer</a> representing livemovies.gr is active in Intellectual Property issues for some years now, so hopefully he will manage to dismiss this case. As the crowd over at <a href="http://www.freestuff.gr/forums/viewtopic.php?t=55435">freestuff.gr</a> has pointed out, this reminds us of a previous case when the administrator of a RSS Aggregator was called to answer for the content of the blogs the feeds of which he was collecting.</li>
