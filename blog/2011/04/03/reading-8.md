Reading #8
==========

Not much reading done for the past couple of days. I am occupied elsewhere, plus I 'm doing some research that might or might not result in a monster post soon.

<h3>Free and Open Source related stuff</h3>
There is <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-gr/2011-March/011307.html">this discussion going on on the ubuntu-gr.org mailing list, regarding the popularity-contest package</a>, its <a href="http://popcon.ubuntu.com/">results</a>, and whether or not the numbers are accurate for <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~dpm/langpacks-by-inst.html">the number of installations of the Greek language pack</a>. The package comes from <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/">Debian</a>, here's the <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/README">README</a> and the <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/FAQ">FAQ</a>.

<a href="http://simos.info/blog/">Simos Xenitellis</a> made a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1398263/UbuntuPopCon-Graph-DRAFT.png">graph of the installations of the Greek language pack as reported by popularity-contest</a>. The graph starts from July 2010, is up-to-date April 2nd 2011, and each line represents on day. 

Additional reading on popularity-contest:<ul><li><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/popcon-are-you-or-out">Popcon - Are You In Or Out?</a></li><li><a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3796126/The-Secret-Lives-of-Ubuntu-and-Debian-Users.htm">The Secret Lives of Ubuntu and Debian Users</a></li><li><a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/popularity-contest/1.48ubuntu1">Source of the current version of the package for Ubuntu</a></li></ul>

Digging a bit further, I found the <a href="http://popcon.ubuntu.com/main/translations/by_inst">list of translations sorted by number of installations</a>, which shows some more realistic results: greek language pack is the 123rd in number of installations (33rd if sorted by "vote", which better indicates recently -less than one month- used installations). 123rd in installations Vs 33rd in usage, I suppose can be interpreted as: "We install less but use more of the installed base", in other words we have more decisive people :)
