Honey, I broke the server
=========================

Here's how I caused 25 minutes of downtime to my web server today.

Upon restart of the http deamon, Apache runs an action called 
`configtest`, which parses all files in `conf.d/` the name of which 
ends in `.conf`, and decides if they are valid configuration files. 
This is defined in your server's configuration file, in a line that 
should be something similar to:

    Include conf.d/*.conf

What I didn't know was that the server will refuse to start altogether, 
if it doesn't like an instruction in those files, so, not only had I 
placed textfiles in that folder that were not valid apache config files, 
but at some point I recommended this to others also. In my case, the 
files were combinations of credentials used for authentication by 
`.htaccess` rules, files produced with `htpasswd`.

The problem only came up when I restarted `httpd` to enable new 
configuration elsewhere. Of course Apache offered a useful explanation 
(where USERNAME and aSdFG123456ASdFG are the username and the hashed 
password used for access by .htaccess):

    Invalid command 'USERNAME:aSdFG123456ASdFG', perhaps misspelled or 
    defined by a module not included in the server configuration
    Action 'configtest' failed.
    The Apache error log may have more information.
        ...fail!

It seemed like a logical and convenient place to put the credentials' 
files upon creation, but it made apache refuse to launch, because I had 
the inspiration to name those files <code>something.conf</code>. I 
checked some older web servers, with prehistoric versions of apache 
-some 5 years old- and I estimate that this is not an issue for those 
versions, I assume that maybe older versions of Apache ignored unknown 
instructions and started anyway.
