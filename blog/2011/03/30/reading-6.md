Regarding that last point, I did some testing and found that the minimum permissions for a php file to execute via the browser are 004, or -------r-- since php is running as "other", or in my case as www-data. The "usual" permissions for php files are 644 or -rw-r--r--.

Now, the minimum permissions of the containing folder, are 001, or d--------x, but some scripts will not work if they are trying to read something in their own folder, or in another folder that has 001 permissions. The "usual" permissions for folders containing php files are 755 or drwxr-xr-x.

In a production environment, one may reduce permissions to some files, e.g. a config.php, to disallow unnecessary access.
