Reading #4
==========

Day off, got to strike out some of the items in the to-read list.

### Free and Open Source Software related stuff ###

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnome3.org/index.html" title="GNOME3">What's new in GNOME3</a> and some <a href="http://www.gnome3.org/faq.html" title="GNOME3 Q&A">common Q&A</a>. Mind that <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/15" title="Fedora 15 Alpha">the current bleeding-edge latest-and-greatest Fedora 15 Alpha</a> already features it, but not yet with the brand new and somewhat brave <a href="https://afaikblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/where-did-the-buttons-go/">removal of the minimize and maximize buttons</a>.</li>
<li>Some interesting numbers in <a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3926941/Linux-Leaders-Debian-and-Ubuntu-Derivative-Distros.htm" title="Mother Distros and derivatives">Linux Leaders: Debian and Ubuntu Derivative Distros</a>: of the four mother distributions, come the derivatives, 63% of which are based on Debian, 15% on RedHat/Fedora, 9% on Slackware and 4% on Gentoo.</li>
<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/430098/">Red Hat (kind of) obfuscates their patches to the kernel</a>, creates some <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Controversy-surrounds-Red-Hat-s-obfuscated-source-code-release-1200554.html">controversy</a>. Technically, they are not violating GPL. Analysis of <a href="http://press.redhat.com/2011/03/04/commitment-to-open/">Red Hat's CTO's blog entry about this</a>, has concluded that <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Red-Hat-defends-changes-to-kernel-source-distribution-1202733.html">they are trying to prevent third parties from selling support for RHCE</a>. <a href="https://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=29147&start=280">CentOS says it's not affected</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Networking related:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/030411-ipv6-home-routers.html" title="IPv6 try-outs on home networking equipment not good.">IPv6 on home routers and DSL/cable modems: FAIL</a>. Also, Cisco says <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/020811-cisco-linksys-ipv6.html" title="LinkSys are not yet IPv6 capable">all LinkSys equipment released so far does not support IPv6</a>, but the open firmware community disagrees, as both OpenWRT and DD-WRT do.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/can-large-scale-nat-save-ipv4" title="Why Large Scale NAT will not save the internet.">Can Large Scale NAT Save IPv4?</a>. The answer is No, if you 're bored to read the entire article. Some of the drawbacks of LSN:<ul><li>Rendering of hosts unidentifiable globally, in other words no more web server at home for your precious blog, but also no more wiretapping of your torrent client (you blatant thief!) -at least not without significant mapping effort on the part of the ISP.</li><li>Huge issues with blacklisting IPs (for spam, for trolling, etc) or whitelisting IPs, behind which large NATed networks may lay.</li><li>Some applications will break under the double NATing of the end user's home router and the ISP's LSN.</li></ul></li>
<li>Mind that the Greek ISP Otenet is <a href="http://ipv6.ote.gr/" title="IPv6 pilot implementation by Greek ISP Otenet">already implementing IPv6 on end customers</a>, and has a <a href="http://ipv6.otenet.gr/?page_id=71" title="Otenet's IPv6 FAQ">useful set of Q&A</a>, as well as a <a href="http://ipv6.otenet.gr/?page_id=43" title="Otenet's list of supported IPv6 CPEs">list of tested and untested CPEs</a>. Also, <a href="http://www.getipv6.info/index.php/Broadband_CPE" title="ARIN's list of IPv6 CPEs">ARIN has an IPv6 CPEs list on its wiki</a>.</li>
<li>It's old news that <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/118969/20110304/libya-cuts-off-internet-engages-kill-switch.htm">Libya got off the net</a>, but the way they did is was interesting: throttling of bandwidth to 0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc geek reading:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ispyce.com/2011/03/smarter-than-you-think-google-cars.html" title="Google car demonstration">Google car was demonstrated recently</a>, but I 'm thinking that the iCar will make it to the market sooner, it will be all-white and round-cornered and its users will boast that it never crashes.</li>
<li>I really dig internet stories that involve Cyprus. Get this: <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/03/chronopays-scareware-diaries/">the largest Russian online payments processing entity, ChronoPays, was running scareware subsidiaries to scam users into paying for useless software</a>, and the payments for those rogue anti-virus software was processed in Cyprus by two companies named Yioliant Holdings and Flytech Classic Distribution Ltd.</li>
<li>Mixed good & bad news from Microsoft: they are <a href="http://ie6countdown.com/">urging users to ditch IE6</a> (the good news) but they are encouraging its replacement with IE9 (the wtf? news). Dear Microsoft, beware! This is bad for karma, you will be reborn as Windows Millennium!</li>
<li>Lastly, I liked <a href="http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1585257" title="Sub-$1000 3-monitors gaming PC">this guy's gaming PC</a>, even though I am not a gamer any more.</li>
</ul>
