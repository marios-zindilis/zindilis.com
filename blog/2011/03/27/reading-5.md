Reading #5
==========

Today's reading material:
<h3>Free and Open Source related stuff:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/23/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_apple_replaces_samba_for_windows_networking_services.html">Samba becomes the second major piece of software that Apple removes from MAC OS because of licensing</a>, after <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/405417/">GCC</a>. Apple, give something back, you bitch.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/will-new-opensuse-with-kde-46-bring-distro-back-from-obscurity/2347?tag=nl.e102">Will new openSUSE with KDE 4.6 bring distro back from obscurity?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Networking related:</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://blog.internetgovernance.org/blog/_archives/2011/3/23/4778509.html">Microsoft wants to buy 666,624 IPv4 from the bankrupt Nortel</a>. The crowd at Slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&type=story&sid=11/03/24/2047258">suggests that IPv4s will start selling in higher prices, like any scarce commodity</a>, which is a bit scary.</li>
<li>Now that they have one less thing to worry about (distributing the shares of the IPv4 pie), <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> can <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51161.html">dispute over whether or not the U.S. Gov't is their daddy</a>, not long after the US <abbr title="Department of Homeland Security">DHS</abbr> swiftly seized a bunch of some 100 domains without sound proof that the owners were doing something wrong. A few clicks later, I found myself resolving <a href="http://www.opennicproject.org/">.free and .oss domains against OpenNIC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc geek reading:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/print/149372">We're paying the contractor for what?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/microsoft-shuts-https-hotmail-over-dozen-countries">Microsoft disabled https access to Hotmail for several countries that already have intense government-side net monitoring</a>, but then <a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=3ba35fa3-e036-4406-b195-585fabf2a030">put it back and said it's a bug, not a feature</a>.</li>
<li>Not exactly reading, but still quite cool, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5QqYVurImY">installing and testing all versions of IE, from 1 to 9</a>. Also some Wireshark digging into each one.</li>
</ul>
