OpenSSL
=======

*   A useful script that discovers the expiry date for a given certificate: 
    [ssl-expiry-date][1]. At some point I slightly modified this script to 
    read a Bind DNS zone file and check each `A` record for SSL Expiry, for 
    the purpose of discovering which subdomains were using a wildcard SSL 
    certificate. I should publish that somewhere some day...

*   A very clear explanation of SSL encryption, not specific to OpenSSL, but 
    it uses OpenSSL for all its examples: 
    [Secure your website with SSL encryption][2].
