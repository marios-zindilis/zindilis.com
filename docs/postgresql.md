Replication
-----------

This is the nicest guide for streaming replication that I've found: 
[Zero to PostgreSQL streaming replication in 10 mins](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2013/02/16/zero-to-postgresql-streaming-replication-in-10-mins/). It is 
written for Ubuntu, but it only needs a couple of steps done differently on 
CentOS, which I have noted in the comments of that article. This guide is not 
as clear (for my preference), but it includes some commands to verify that the 
replication is running: [How To Setup PostgreSQL Replication On CentOS](http://www.unixmen.com/setup-postgresql-replication-centos/).
