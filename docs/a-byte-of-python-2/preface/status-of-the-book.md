Status of the Book
==================

Simirarly to many libre and open source projects, this book is at a constant 
work-in-progress status. Many chapters are constantly being changed and 
improved. However, the book has matured a lot. You should be able to learn 
Python easily from this book. Please do tell me if you find any part of the 
book to be incorrect or incomprehensible.

More chapters are planned for the future, such as on wxPython, Twisted and 
maybe even Boa Constructor.

*Editor's Note*: The version of the book as published on this website is a 
lightly edited version of the original book, which is now available on 
[iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/swaroopch/byteofpython/read/).
