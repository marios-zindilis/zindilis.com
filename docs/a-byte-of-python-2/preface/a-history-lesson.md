A History Lesson
================

Swaroop C H, the author of this book, wrote in the initial form of the book:

> I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for my 
> software "Diamond" so that I could make the installation easy. I had to 
> choose between Python and Perl bindings for the Qt library. I did some 
> research on the web and I came across an article where Eric S. Raymond, the 
> famous and respected hacker, talked about how Python has become his favorite 
> programming language. I also found out that the PyQt bindings were very good 
> compared to Perl-Qt. So, I decided that Python was the language for me.
> 
> Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find any! I 
> did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too expensive or were more 
> like a reference manual than a guide. So, I settled for the documentation 
> that came with Python. However, it was too brief and small. It did give a 
> good idea about Python but was not complete. I managed with it since I had 
> previous programming experience, but it was unsuitable for newbies.
> 
> About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the (then) 
> latest Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. I got excited 
> about it and suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff on Python. I 
> started writing a few pages but it quickly became 30 pages long. Then, I 
> became serious about making it more useful in a book form. After a lot of 
> rewrites, it has reached a stage where it has become a useful guide to 
> learning the Python language. I consider this book to be my contribution and 
> tribute to the open source community.
> 
> This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still consider it 
> in the same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to make it more 
> palatable to others :)
> 
> In the true spirit of open source, I have received lots of constructive 
> suggestions, criticisms and feedback from enthusiastic readers which has 
> helped me improve this book a lot.
