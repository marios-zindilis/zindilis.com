Preface
=======

Python is probably one of the few programming languages that are both simple 
and powerful. This is good for both beginners as well as experts, and more 
importantly, it is fun to program with. This book aims to help you learn this 
wonderful language and show you how to get things done quickly and painlessly. 
In effect, this book is "*The Perfect Anti-/Venom to your programming 
problems*".

Who This Book Is For
--------------------

This book serves as a guide or tutorial to the Python programming language. It 
is mainly targeted at newbies, but is also useful for experienced programmers.

The only prerequisite to learning Python from reading this book, is that you 
know how to save text files on a computer. If, however, you have previous 
programming experience in any other language, you can learn Python from this 
book.

If you do have previous programming experience, you will be interested in the 
differences between Python and your favorite programming language, and many 
such differences are highlighted throughout the book. A little warning though: 
Python is soon going to become your *new* favorite programming language!
