The Software Development Process
================================

We have now gone through the various phases in the process of writing a software. These phases can be summarised as follows:

1.  What (Analysis)
2.  How (Design)
3.  Do It (Implementation)
4.  Test (Testing and Debugging)
5.  Use (Operation or Deployment)
6.  Maintain (Refinement)

<h4><b>Important</b></h4>
<p>A recommended way of writing programs is the procedure we have followed in creating the backup script - Do the analysis and design. Start implementing with a simple version. Test and debug it. Use it to ensure that it works as expected. Now, add any features that you want and continue to repeat the Do It-Test-Use cycle as many times as required. Remember, <b>'Software is grown, not built'</b>.</p></aside>
