A History Lesson
----------------

Swaroop C H, the author of this book, wrote in the initial form of the 
book:

> I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for 
> my software "Diamond" so that I could make the installation easy. I 
> had to choose between Python and Perl bindings for the Qt library. I 
> did some research on the web and I came across an article where Eric 
> S. Raymond, the famous and respected hacker, talked about how Python 
> has become his favorite programming language. I also found out that 
> the PyQt bindings were very good compared to Perl-Qt. So, I decided 
> that Python was the language for me.
>
> Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find 
> any! I did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too expensive 
> or were more like a reference manual than a guide. So, I settled for 
> the documentation that came with Python. However, it was too brief 
> and small. It did give a good idea about Python but was not complete. 
> I managed with it since I had previous programming experience, but it 
> was unsuitable for newbies.
> 
> About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the 
> (then) latest Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. 
> I got excited about it and suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff 
> on Python. I started writing a few pages but it quickly became 30 
> pages long. Then, I became serious about making it more useful in a 
> book form. After a lot of rewrites, it has reached a stage where it 
> has become a useful guide to learning the Python language. I consider 
> this book to be my contribution and tribute to the open source 
> community.
>
> This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still 
> consider it in the same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to 
> make it more palatable to others :)
>
> In the true spirit of open source, I have received lots of 
> constructive suggestions, criticisms and feedback from enthusiastic 
> readers which has helped me improve this book a lot. 

Status Of The Book
------------------

Simirarly to many libre and open source projects, this book is at a 
constant work-in-progress status. Many chapters are constantly being 
changed and improved. However, the book has matured a lot. You should 
be able to learn Python easily from this book. Please do tell me if 
you find any part of the book to be incorrect or incomprehensible.

More chapters are planned for the future, such as on wxPython, Twisted 
and maybe even Boa Constructor.

*Editor's Note*: The version of the book as published on this website 
is a lightly edited version of the original book, which is now 
available on [iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/swaroopch/byteofpython/read/).

Official Website
----------------

Originally, the official website of the book was www.byteofpython.info, 
but that website is no longer active. Instead, the version of the book 
writte for Python 2 is currently freely available at 
[iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/swaroopch/byteofpython/read/).

The most current version of the book, focusing on Python 3, is available at 
[the author's website](http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/).

Something To Think About
------------------------
C. A. R. Hoare:
> There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to 
> make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies; the other 
> is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.

C. W. Wendte:
> Success in life is a matter not so much of talend and opportunity as 
> of concentration and perseverance.
