keepalived
==========

Notes:

*   **`lb_algo`** determines *which* real server gets to serve a request, and 
    possible algorithms include round-robin (weighted or not), least-connections 
    (weighted or not), etc (see RHEL docs).
*   **`lb_kind`** determines *how* the real server receives the request, and 
    the supported methods on RHEL 7 are NAT and DR.

`lb_kind DR`
------------

Notes:

*   The load balancers and the real servers need to be on the same network 
    segment
*   The Virtual IP is configured on all real servers, and real servers need to 
    be configured to ignore ARP requests for the virtual IP. This can be 
    achieved with either `arptables`, or `iptables` or `sysctl` configuration.
